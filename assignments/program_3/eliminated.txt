// ProgramName: Program-3
// Author: Austin Riddle
// Description:
// 		This program reads in animals from a text file called
// animals.txt.  It places the animals into a doubly linked list
// where the head and tail are connected.  The program will then
// eliminate a given number of animals from the list using an
// algorithm to determine the order of who will be eliminated.
// The algorithm uses a multiplier, which you will also input.
// The program will only print every 11th eliminated animals.
// The final printed animal is the winner.
//
// The program seems to struggle when too high a number is
// entered for 'number of times to eliminate'. Recommend 74
// or lower, with a multiplier of 2.
// Unfortunately, I have been unable to determine the cause.
